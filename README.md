Project Topic : 
Solving the VRP "Vehicle Routing Problem" using Swarm Intelligence: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm 

 (Presentation Topic: Swarm Intelligence: ACO algo.)

Project Descripation : 

The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization and integer programming problem which asks: 
    
    What is the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of customers? 
    
It generalises the well-known travelling salesman problem (TSP). 

The VRP concerns the service of a delivery company. 

How things are delivered from one or more depots which has a given set of home vehicles and operated by a set of drivers who can move on a given road network to a set of customers. 

It asks for a determination of a set of routes, S, (one route for each vehicle that must start and finish at its own depot) 

such that all customers' requirements and operational constraints are satisfied, 

and the global transportation cost is minimized. 

This cost may be monetary, distance or otherwise.
